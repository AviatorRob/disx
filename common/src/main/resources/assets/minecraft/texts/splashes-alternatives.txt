Goodbye Yellow Brick Road!
Don't you... forget about me!
Sweet Dreams are Made of This!
Here Comes the Sun!
Yesterday I'm not half the man I used to be!
All the lonely people.. where do they all come from?
Imagine all the people.. living for today!
I'm still standing better than I ever did!
Too much time on my hands!
Comme d'habitude!
Hit the road Jack!
Say it loud!
I feel good!
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing!
Sweet Caroline!
I am, I said!
Good bye, Ruby Tuesday!
I see a red door and I want it painted black!
Mr. Blue Sky?
